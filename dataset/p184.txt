1. Abridged Problem Statement  
Given integers P, M, C (available grams/ml of flour, milk, and cabbage) and K, R, V (grams/ml needed per patty), compute the maximum number of patties one can make. That is, output floor(min(P/K, M/R, C/V)).

2. Detailed Editorial  
We need to determine how many patties Petya can cook without running out of any one of the three key ingredients. Each ingredient imposes its own limit:  
- From the flour supply P, you can make at most ⌊P/K⌋ patties.  
- From the milk supply M, at most ⌊M/R⌋ patties.  
- From the cabbage supply C, at most ⌊C/V⌋ patties.  

Because you must have all three ingredients available to make each patty, the true maximum is the smallest of these three values.  

Steps to solve:  
1. Read P, M, C, K, R, V.  
2. Compute x1 = P / K, x2 = M / R, x3 = C / V using integer division (floor).  
3. The answer is min(x1, x2, x3).  
4. Print that minimum.  

Time complexity is O(1) and memory usage is negligible. Given 1 ≤ P, M, C, K, R, V ≤ 10000, divisions and comparisons fit easily into 32- or 64-bit integers.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Helper to update x = min(x, y)
template<class T>
inline void chkmin(T& x, const T& y) {
    if (x > y) {
        x = y;
    }
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    // Input quantities: P = flour, M = milk, C = cabbage
    // and per-patty requirements K, R, V
    long long P, M, C;
    long long K, R, V;
    cin >> P >> M >> C;
    cin >> K >> R >> V;

    // Compute how many patties each ingredient can support
    long long maxByFlour = P / K;
    long long maxByMilk  = M / R;
    long long maxByCabb  = C / V;

    // The actual maximum is the smallest of these three
    long long answer = maxByFlour;
    chkmin(answer, maxByMilk);
    chkmin(answer, maxByCabb);

    cout << answer << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

```python
def main():
    # Read six integers from input: P, M, C, K, R, V
    P, M, C, K, R, V = map(int, input().split())

    # Compute maximum patties by each resource
    max_by_flour = P // K     # integer division
    max_by_milk  = M // R
    max_by_cabb  = C // V

    # The limiting factor is the minimum of the three
    answer = min(max_by_flour, max_by_milk, max_by_cabb)

    # Print the result
    print(answer)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
