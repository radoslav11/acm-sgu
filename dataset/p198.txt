1) Abridged problem statement
- You are given N solid circular island pieces (xi, yi, ri) in the plane and a circular ship (cx, cy, cr).
- The ship may move freely (can touch islands, but must never intersect them).
- Decide whether the ship can move arbitrarily far away from its starting position (escape to infinity). Print YES if it can, otherwise NO.

2) Detailed editorial
- Geometric reduction (Minkowski sum):
  - Expand every island radius by the ship radius cr and shift coordinates so the ship starts at the origin.
  - After this, the ship is a point at (0,0), and the obstacles are discs centered at (xi−cx, yi−cy) with radii (ri+cr). The initial position is guaranteed to be in free space.

- Key observation:
  - The origin is trapped (cannot escape to infinity) if and only if the union of the expanded discs contains a closed curve that winds around the origin. A practical sufficient/necessary certificate is a cycle of pairwise-intersecting discs that encircles the origin.

- Turning-angle graph:
  - For each disc i, compute its polar angle θi around the origin.
  - For any two discs i and j that intersect or touch (distance between centers ≤ sum of radii), consider the minimal signed angular rotation δ(i→j) needed to turn from θi to θj. Normalize δ to be in (−π, π].
  - Build a directed graph with an edge i→j of weight δ(i→j). Also add j→i with weight −δ(i→j).

- Why this works:
  - Along a chain of overlapping discs, the “view” from the origin cannot jump more than π at each step; the cumulative rotation along a closed loop around the origin must be ±2π. Thus, a loop that surrounds the origin clockwise induces a total δ-sum near −2π; counterclockwise yields +2π. Because we add both directions for each pair, any enclosing loop yields a negative cycle in at least one direction.
  - Therefore, detecting a negative cycle of magnitude at least about π is enough to conclude entrapment. The provided solution flags entrapment when the shortest i→i cycle sum is < −π.

- Algorithm:
  - Inflate and shift all discs.
  - For each pair (i, j), if discs overlap, compute δ(i→j) and set dist[i][j] = δ(i→j), dist[j][i] = −δ(i→j); if they don’t overlap, set dist[i][j] = +∞.
  - Run Floyd–Warshall on dist with a tiny epsilon in relaxations for numerical robustness.
  - If any dist[i][i] < −π, print NO (trapped). Otherwise, print YES (can escape).

- Correctness outline:
  - If there is a cycle of overlapping discs that winds around the origin, following the cycle in the appropriate direction yields a total δ close to −2π; Floyd–Warshall will find a negative cycle with weight < −π, thus we answer NO.
  - If there is no such enclosing cycle, there is no negative cycle with weight ≤ −π; the union of obstacles does not separate the origin from infinity, hence YES.

- Complexity:
  - Building the graph: O(N^2).
  - Floyd–Warshall: O(N^3) = 27e6 updates for N=300, which fits easily in C++ within the limits.
  - Numerical details: use EPS ~ 1e−6, normalize angles with care. Using atan2 is convenient; the given C++ uses acos with sign fix.

5) Compressed editorial
- Inflate each island radius by the ship radius and shift coordinates so the ship becomes a point at the origin.
- Build a graph on discs: connect i and j if their inflated discs intersect. For each such pair, compute the minimal signed angular difference δ ∈ (−π, π] from the angle of ci to cj (as seen from the origin). Add directed edges i→j with weight δ and j→i with weight −δ.
- Run Floyd–Warshall on this graph. If any dist[i][i] < −π after closure, there is a cycle whose total rotation is about −2π, i.e., an enclosing loop around the origin; answer NO. Otherwise answer YES.
- Complexity: O(N^3) with N ≤ 300. Use small eps for numeric stability.
