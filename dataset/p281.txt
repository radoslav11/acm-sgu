1) Abridged problem statement
- You are given N unique team names and two full rankings (permutations) of these teams.
- The final ranking must satisfy: for every M where the sets of the first M teams in both rankings are identical, the first M in the final ranking is exactly that set.
- Whenever the rule does not fix the relative order of some teams, they must be ordered alphabetically.
- Output the final ranking (one team per line).

2) Detailed editorial
Key idea
- The rule fixes “cut positions” M where the set of the first M teams is the same in both rankings. Between two consecutive cuts, nothing else is fixed, so teams in that block must be alphabetically sorted.
- There are two natural ways to compute the final order:
  A) Graph/SCC method (the provided C++ solution)
  B) A direct linear scan using positions and block boundaries (simpler)

A) Graph/SCC method (as in the provided C++ code)
- Build a directed graph on the N teams (we map each team to its index in the first ranking).
- Add edges that go from each item to the previous item (i -> i-1) in:
  - ranking 1, and
  - ranking 2 (converted to indices of ranking 1 via name_to_id).
- Intuition: In each ranking, there is a directed path from a later team to any earlier team. By adding edges for both rankings, whenever two teams must be comparable due to the rule, you’ll have one-way reachability; when two teams are mutually reachable (a cycle), their relative order cannot be deduced and they must be alphabetically ordered.
- Compute strongly connected components (SCCs). Teams in the same SCC form a “tie block”.
- The condensation of this graph (SCC DAG) is a chain: because we added i -> i-1 for the first ranking, there’s always a path from any later index to any earlier index, so any two SCCs are comparable.
- Order the SCCs by the minimum index (in ranking 1) they contain. This is a topological order of the chain.
- Within each SCC, sort team names alphabetically (the code implicitly does this by sorting pairs (min_index_of_component, name)).
- Output teams in the order of components; teams within the same component in lexicographical order.

Correctness
- If two teams lie in different SCCs, then in the condensation chain one component precedes the other. Hence the relative order between those components is fixed and respects both rankings’ prefix-equality rule.
- If two teams lie in the same SCC, there is a cycle between them using edges that come only from adjacent constraints in both rankings. That means no M exists where exactly one of them is in the prefix set in both rankings. So their relative order is not determined by the rule, hence we sort them alphabetically.

Complexity
- Building the graph uses O(N) edges (2N-2).
- Kosaraju’s SCC is O(N).
- Sorting by groups and lexicographically is O(N log N).
- Memory: O(N).

B) Simpler alternative (linear scan + block sorting)
- Map each team to its position in the second ranking: pos2[name].
- Iterate the first ranking from left to right; maintain max_pos = max(pos2[a[i]] over the current prefix).
- Whenever max_pos == i, the set of the first i+1 in ranking 1 matches the set of the first i+1 in ranking 2; that index is a block boundary.
- Alphabetically sort the teams of the current block and append to the answer; start a new block after it.
- This yields the same result and is very simple. Complexity is also O(N log N) due to sorting within blocks.

4) Python solution (detailed comments, direct linear scan + block sort)
Note: This is the simpler alternative described in the editorial (method B). It produces exactly the same final ranking required by the statement.

import sys

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()
    it = iter(data)

    # Read number of teams
    n = int(next(it))

    # Read the two rankings
    ord1 = [next(it) for _ in range(n)]
    ord2 = [next(it) for _ in range(n)]

    # Map each team to its position in the second ranking (0-based)
    pos2 = {name: i for i, name in enumerate(ord2)}

    # We will scan ord1 left-to-right and maintain the maximum pos2 seen so far.
    # When max_pos2 == i, the set of ord1[0..i] equals the set of ord2[0..i].
    # That means we have a "block boundary". We sort that block alphabetically.
    answer = []            # Collect the final order here
    block = []             # Current block of names since last boundary
    max_pos2 = -1          # Max position in ord2 among names in current block

    for i, name in enumerate(ord1):
        block.append(name)                 # Include this name in current block
        max_pos2 = max(max_pos2, pos2[name])  # Update the furthest ord2 position reached

        # If the prefix sets match in both orders at this i,
        # we flush the block sorted alphabetically.
        if max_pos2 == i:
            block.sort()                   # Relative order not fixed -> alphabetical
            answer.extend(block)           # Add to final answer
            block.clear()                  # Start a new block for the next segment

    # Safety: in well-formed inputs, block must be empty here.
    # But if not, sort and append (handles any trailing block).
    if block:
        block.sort()
        answer.extend(block)

    # Output the final ranking
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(answer))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Why this works
- At step i, max_pos2 equals the highest index in ord2 among teams seen so far in ord1. If max_pos2 == i, we have encountered exactly the set of teams placed in the first i+1 positions of ord2, hence the prefix sets coincide. Therefore, the current block’s membership is fixed, but not its internal order, so we sort it alphabetically.
- This exactly implements the rule and yields the same result as the SCC approach.

Complexity
- O(n) scanning plus sorting inside blocks; worst-case O(n log n).

5) Compressed editorial
- Build precedence constraints from adjacent pairs in both rankings by adding edges from each team to its predecessor in each ranking.
- Teams that mutually reach each other (SCCs) are exactly those whose relative order cannot be deduced from the “equal prefix sets” rule; they must be sorted alphabetically.
- The SCC condensation is a chain since we always add edges i -> i-1 for ranking 1, so components can be ordered by the smallest index they contain in ranking 1.
- Output teams sorted by (component_min_index, name).
- Alternatively, scan ranking 1, track the maximum position reached in ranking 2; whenever it equals the current index, you’ve found a block boundary. Sort each block alphabetically and concatenate.
