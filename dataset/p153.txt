1. Concise Problem Statement  
You have a heap of N matches. Two players alternate removing matches, where on each move a player may take exactly 1 or one of the values P₁,…,Pₘ (each between 2 and 9). The player who takes the last match **loses**. Given N (up to 10⁹) and the set {P₁,…,Pₘ}, determine which player has a forced win under perfect play.

2. Detailed Editorial  

Game reformulation  
- This is a subtraction (take-away) game under **misère** rule: the player taking the last object loses.  
- Let S = {1, P₁, P₂, …, Pₘ}. Moves from a heap of size i are to i − s for any s∈S with s ≤ i.

Dynamic programming  
- Define dp[i] = 1 if the position with i matches is winning for the player to move, and dp[i] = 0 if it is losing.  
- Base: dp[0] = 1, because if there are 0 matches on your turn, your opponent just took the last one and lost—so you “win” by default.  
- dp[i] = 1 if there exists an s∈S, s ≤ i, such that transitioning to i−s yields a losing position dp[i−s] = 0. Otherwise dp[i] = 0.

Misère subtlety  
- In normal play you win by taking the last object; in misère play you lose by taking the last object. However, because we include move of size 1 and the heap is never left with a “poisoned” last object except at size 0, the simple DP above with dp[0]=1 and dp[1]=0 handles the misère condition correctly.

Periodicity for large N  
- Since all allowed moves are at most 9, dp[i] depends only on the previous 9 values. Therefore the sequence dp[0], dp[1], … is eventually periodic with period at most 2¹⁰ (the number of distinct bit-patterns of length 10).  
- We compute dp[i] and maintain a 10-bit “state” encoding which of dp[i],dp[i−1],…,dp[i−9] are winning. As soon as a state repeats at two different i’s, we detect a cycle.  
- Let i₁ < i₂ be the two occurrences of the same state; cycle_length = i₂ − i₁. For any N ≥ i₂, dp[N] = dp[i₁ + ((N−i₁) mod cycle_length)].

Complexity  
- We only need to compute up to when a cycle is found, which is at most a few thousand steps (≤ around 1024 states). Each step checks up to m+1 moves (≤9). Overall O(1024·9) per test case.

5. Compressed Editorial  
- Model the game as a misère subtraction game with moves S = {1, P₁,…,Pₘ}.  
- dp[i] = winning iff ∃s∈S s.t. dp[i−s] is losing; dp[0]=1, dp[1]=0.  
- Because S’s maximum is ≤9, the sequence dp is eventually periodic with period ≤2¹⁰.  
- Detect the cycle by hashing the last 10 dp bits into a state, record first occurrence, and when repeated, use modular arithmetic to find dp[N].
