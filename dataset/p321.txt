1. Abridged Problem Statement  
Given a directed tree of N spies (nodes) with unique paths from every spy to the root (spy 1). Each of the N−1 edges is either “protected” or “almost protected.” A path is safe if at least half of its edges are protected. You may upgrade some almost‐protected edges to protected. Find a minimum set of edges to upgrade so that every path from any spy to spy 1 is safe, and output their input indices.

2. Detailed Editorial  

• Root the tree at node 1 and do a DFS, keeping track of the current depth d (number of edges from root) and the set S of “almost‐protected” edges on the current root‐to‐u path.  
• At any node u, there are d total edges on its path, of which |S| are almost. The safety condition is: number of protected ≥ number of almost ⇒ d−|S| ≥ |S| ⇒ 2|S| ≤ d.  
• If 2|S| > d at node u, we must immediately upgrade one of the almost‐protected edges on the path. To maximize the benefit (so that future deeper nodes also have fewer almost edges), we choose the one closest to the root—that is, the almost edge with minimum depth. Remove it from S (meaning we treat it as protected hereafter), and record its index in the answer list.  
• Continue DFS, inserting each almost edge (with its depth and index) when descending, and removing it when backtracking—unless it was already removed by an upgrade.  
• This greedy is optimal because we only upgrade when strictly necessary, and each upgrade is placed to cover as many future violations as possible. Each edge is inserted/removed at most once, and each upgrade uses a set (or priority queue) operation, so total O(N log N).

5. Compressed Editorial  
Perform a DFS from the root, tracking the multiset S of almost-protected edges on the current path by their depths. At each node of depth d, if 2|S|>d, greedily convert (remove from S and record) the almost-protected edge of minimum depth. This ensures all root‐to‐node paths satisfy protected≥almost, uses the fewest upgrades, and runs in O(N log N).
