1. Abridged Problem Statement  
You have N tanks (numbered 1…N), each starting with 100 hit points (HP) and 0 score. You are given a log of M successful hits: each entry is (shooter, target). For each hit in order:  
- If the target’s HP before the hit was >0, the shooter gains 3 score points.  
- The target loses 8 HP (HP may go below zero).  
After processing all hits, every tank that still has HP>0 earns a bonus of ⌊HP/2⌋ points.  
Output for tanks 1 through N their final HP and final score.

2. Detailed Editorial  
We can directly simulate the battle in O(M+N) time and O(N) space, since N≤6 and M≤4000.  

Initialization  
- Create two arrays of length N:  
  hp[i] = 100 (hit points for tank i)  
  score[i] = 0 (score points for tank i)  

Processing each shot (shooter s, target t):  
- Convert to zero-based: s–; t–.  
- Check if target is still “alive,” i.e., hp[t] > 0. If so, the shooter earns +3 score points.  
- Subtract 8 from hp[t]: hp[t] -= 8. It is allowed for hp[t] to become negative; “dead” tanks stay dead.  
- We do not need to check the shooter’s HP for activity because the problem guarantees that only active tanks appear as shooters in the log.  

After all hits:  
- For each tank i with hp[i] > 0, add a bonus of floor(hp[i]/2) to score[i].  
- Print for each tank i (in order 1…N): hp[i] and score[i].  

Implementation details  
- Use 32-bit ints for HP and score (all intermediate values are small).  
- Reading input: first line N, M; then M lines of (s, t).  
- Direct array indexing and updates suffice.  

Complexities  
- Time: O(M + N)  
- Memory: O(N)

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int N, M;
    // Read number of tanks N and number of shots M
    cin >> N >> M;

    // Initialize hit points and score arrays
    vector<int> hp(N, 100);      // All tanks start with 100 HP
    vector<int> score(N, 0);     // All tanks start with 0 score

    // Process each shot in the log
    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
        int s, t;
        cin >> s >> t;           // read shooter s and target t (1-based)
        s--;                      // convert to 0-based index
        t--;

        // If the target was still alive before this hit, shooter gains 3 points
        if (hp[t] > 0) {
            score[s] += 3;
        }
        // Subtract 8 HP from the target (can go negative)
        hp[t] -= 8;
    }

    // After all shots, award bonus points to tanks still alive
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        if (hp[i] > 0) {
            score[i] += hp[i] / 2;  // integer division gives floor(hp/2)
        }
    }

    // Output final HP and score for each tank in order
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        cout << hp[i] << " " << score[i] << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}

4. Python Solution with Detailed Comments  
```python
def process_match():
    # Read N (tanks) and M (shots)
    N, M = map(int, input().split())

    # Read the list of shots: each is (shooter, target)
    shots = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]

    # Initialize hit points and scores
    hit_points = [100] * N   # All tanks start with 100 HP
    score_points = [0] * N   # All tanks start with 0 score

    # Simulate each shot in chronological order
    for shooter, target in shots:
        s = shooter - 1       # Convert to 0-based index
        t = target - 1

        # If target was alive (>0 HP) before the hit, shooter gets +3 points
        if hit_points[t] > 0:
            score_points[s] += 3

        # Apply damage: subtract 8 HP from the target
        hit_points[t] -= 8

    # After all shots, give bonus to tanks still alive
    for i in range(N):
        if hit_points[i] > 0:
            # Bonus is floor(hit_points / 2)
            score_points[i] += hit_points[i] // 2

    # Print the result: for each tank, its final HP and score
    for i in range(N):
        print(hit_points[i], score_points[i])

# Run the function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    process_match()
```

5. Compressed Editorial  
Simulate directly. Maintain `hp[i]`=100 and `score[i]`=0 for i=1…N. For each shot (s→t): if `hp[t]>0` then `score[s]+=3`; then `hp[t]-=8`. After all shots, for each alive tank add `hp[i]//2` to `score[i]`. Print `(hp[i], score[i])`. Time O(M+N).
