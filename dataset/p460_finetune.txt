460. Plural Form of Nouns

input: standard
output: standard

In the English language, nouns are inflected by grammatical number — that is singular or plural. In this problem we use a simple model of constructing plural from a singular form. This model doesn't always make English plural forms correctly, but it works in most cases. Forget about the real rules you know while solving the problem and use the statement as a formal document.

You are given several nouns in a singular form and your program should translate them into plural form using the following rules:


If a singular noun ends with ch, x, s, o the plural is formed by adding es. For example, witch -> witches, tomato -> tomatoes.

If a singular noun ends with f or fe, the plural form ends with ves. For example, leaf -> leaves, knife -> knives. Pay attention to the letter f becoming v.

Nouns ending with y change the ending to ies in plural. For example, family -> families.

In all other cases plural is formed by adding s. For example, book -> books.


Input
The first line of input contains a single positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) — the number of words to be processed. The following n lines contain one word each. A word consists from 2 to 25 lowercase Latin letters. It is not guaranteed that the given words are real English words from vocabulary.

Output
Print n given words in their plural forms on separate lines. Keep the words in the same order as they are given in the input.

1. Abridged Problem Statement  
You are given n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) lowercase words (length 2–25). For each word, produce its “plural” form using these simplified rules (apply exactly one):

  • If it ends in “ch”, “x”, “s”, or “o”: append “es”.  
  • Else if it ends in “f” or “fe”: replace that ending with “ves” (the “f” becomes “v”).  
  • Else if it ends in “y”: replace “y” with “ies”.  
  • Otherwise: append “s”.  

Output the transformed words in the same order, one per line.

2. Key Observations  
- Suffix checks must be precise and in a safe order so you don’t misclassify (e.g. check “ch” before looking at only the last character).  
- When handling “fe”, you need to remove only the ‘e’ first so that you turn the final ‘f’ into ‘v’.  
- Each word’s maximum length is 25, and n ≤ 10, so any straightforward string operations (suffix tests, concatenations) run in negligible time.  
- The rules are mutually exclusive: once one suffix rule applies, you stop and form the plural.

3. Full Solution Approach  
1. Read integer n.  
2. Loop over the next n lines, each giving a word s.  
3. For each s, do:  
   a. If s ends with “ch” (i.e. length ≥2 and s.substr(len−2)==“ch”) or its last letter is one of {‘o’,‘x’,‘s’}, then plural = s + “es”.  
   b. Else if s ends with “f” or “fe”:  
       - If it ends with “fe”, drop the trailing ‘e’ first.  
       - Change the final ‘f’ to ‘v’.  
       - Append “es”.  
   c. Else if s ends with ‘y’: drop that ‘y’ and append “ies”.  
   d. Else: plural = s + “s”.  
4. Print each plural form on its own line.  

Time Complexity: O(n·L) where L≤25. Memory: O(L) per word.

4. C++ Implementation with Detailed Comments  
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int n;
    cin >> n;                   // Number of words to process

    while (n--) {
        string s;
        cin >> s;
        int len = s.size();

        // Rule A: ends with "ch", or single 'o', 'x', 's'
        if ((len >= 2 && s[len-2] == 'c' && s[len-1] == 'h') 
            || s[len-1] == 'o'
            || s[len-1] == 'x'
            || s[len-1] == 's') 
        {
            // Simply append "es"
            cout << s << "es\n";
        }
        // Rule B: ends with 'f' or "fe"
        else if (s[len-1] == 'f' 
                 || (len >= 2 && s[len-2] == 'f' && s[len-1] == 'e')) 
        {
            // If ends with "fe", drop the 'e' to expose 'f'
            if (s[len-1] == 'e') {
                s.pop_back();    // remove trailing 'e'
                --len;
            }
            // Now s[len-1] == 'f'; change it to 'v'
            s[len-1] = 'v';
            // Append "es" to form the plural
            cout << s << "es\n";
        }
        // Rule C: ends with 'y'
        else if (s[len-1] == 'y') 
        {
            // Drop 'y', append "ies"
            s.pop_back();
            cout << s << "ies\n";
        }
        // Rule D: all other cases
        else {
            cout << s << "s\n";
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

5. Python Implementation with Detailed Comments  
```python
import sys

def pluralize(word):
    # Rule A: ends with "ch" or one of 'o','x','s'
    if word.endswith('ch') or word[-1] in {'o','x','s'}:
        return word + 'es'

    # Rule B: ends with "fe" or single 'f'
    if word.endswith('fe'):
        # Drop 'fe', add 'ves'
        return word[:-2] + 'ves'
    if word.endswith('f'):
        # Drop 'f', add 'ves'
        return word[:-1] + 'ves'

    # Rule C: ends with 'y'
    if word.endswith('y'):
        # Drop 'y', add 'ies'
        return word[:-1] + 'ies'

    # Rule D: default case
    return word + 's'

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    words = data[1:]
    # Process exactly n words
    for w in words[:n]:
        print(pluralize(w))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Explanation of Key Steps:  
- We test the longest relevant suffix first when needed (e.g. “ch” before testing just “h”).  
- For the “f”/“fe” rule, dropping only the ‘e’ in “fe” ensures we can consistently replace one ‘f’ with ‘v’.  
- Since each input word is ≤25 characters and n ≤10, this direct approach is efficient and simple.
