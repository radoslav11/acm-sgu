1. Abridged Problem Statement  
Given an n×n chessboard (1≤n≤10) and an integer k (0≤k≤n²), count the number of ways to place k identical queens so that no two attack each other (i.e., no two share a row, column, or diagonal).

2. Detailed Editorial  

We need to count all configurations of k queens on an n×n board so that no two are in line vertically, horizontally, or along either diagonal. A classic approach is backtracking (depth-first search) that proceeds row by row:

 1. We maintain a structure (here, a 2D array `attacked[row][col]`) that records how many queens attack a given square. A square is safe if its attacked count is zero.
 2. We write a recursive function `brute(row, k_left)` which returns the number of ways to place `k_left` queens on rows `row..n−1`.  
    - Prune immediately if `k_left > n − row` (not enough rows remain).
    - If `row == n`, we have considered all rows: return 1 if `k_left == 0`, else 0.
    - First, consider _not_ placing a queen on this row at all: `ans = brute(row+1, k_left)`.
    - Then, for each column `col` in `[0..n-1]`, if `(row,col)` is safe (`attacked[row][col]==0`) and `k_left>0`, we:
        a. Mark the new queen by incrementing `attacked` on its row, column, and both diagonals (`change_queen`).
        b. Recurse: `ans += brute(row+1, k_left-1)`.
        c. Unmark (subtract) to restore state.
 3. The function `change_queen(row, col, delta)` walks outwards in all eight directions from `(row,col)`, adding `delta` (±1) to `attacked`. We subtract an extra `3*delta` at the end to correct for the overcount at `(row,col)` itself (since the four “directional” loops each revisit it).
 4. The total number of valid placements is `brute(0, k)` with an initially zeroed `attacked` grid.
  
Time complexity: In the worst case (small k), the branching factor is O(n) per row, depth ≤ n, yielding something like O(nⁿ) in the absolute worst—but n≤10 makes this feasible, and pruning by `k_left` further reduces branches.

```python
def count_configurations(n, k):
    """
    Count ways to place k queens on an n×n board without attacks,
    proceeding row by row.
    """

    # Use bitmasks to track attacked columns and diagonals:
    # `cols`  : columns under attack
    # `d1`    : "main" diagonals under attack (row+col)
    # `d2`    : "anti" diagonals under attack (row-col + (n-1))
    ALL = (1 << n) - 1  # mask of n one-bits

    from functools import lru_cache

    @lru_cache(None)
    def dfs(row, placed, cols, d1, d2):
        # placed = number of queens already placed
        # row = next row index to consider
        if placed == k:
            # All required queens placed: any remaining rows can be empty
            return 1
        if row == n:
            # No more rows
            return 0
        # Prune: if even placing one queen per remaining row can't reach k
        if placed + (n - row) < k:
            return 0

        ways = 0
        # 1) Skip placing on this row
        ways += dfs(row+1, placed, cols, d1<<1, d2>>1)

        # 2) Place exactly one queen in any safe column on this row
        # safe positions = those columns not in cols, and not attacked on diagonals
        attacked = cols | d1 | d2
        free_positions = (~attacked) & ALL
        while free_positions:
            # pick lowest set bit
            bit = free_positions & -free_positions
            free_positions -= bit
            # Set that bit in cols;
            # shift diagonals for next row
            ways += dfs(
                row+1,
                placed+1,
                cols | bit,
                (d1 | bit) << 1,
                (d2 | bit) >> 1
            )
        return ways

    return dfs(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_configurations(n, k))
```

Explanation of the Python approach:  
- We encode the board state in three bitmasks—columns, main diagonals, and anti-diagonals.  
- At each row, we can either skip placing a queen (so just update the diagonals' masks by shifting), or place one queen in any free column (bit not set in any of the three masks).  
- We recurse until we have placed k queens or run out of rows, using memoization (`lru_cache`) to avoid recomputation.

5. Compressed Editorial  

We use a depth-first search over rows, keeping track of attacked squares. At each row, we either skip placing a queen or place one in any safe column (attacked count zero). We prune when too few rows remain to fit the remaining queens. The complexity is acceptable for n≤10. A bitmask variant replaces the 2D attacked array with three integer masks—columns, main diagonals, and anti-diagonals—and shifts them as we move down the rows, with memoization to accelerate overlapping subproblems.
