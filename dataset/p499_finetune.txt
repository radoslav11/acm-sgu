Andrew has just made a breakthrough in sociology: he realized how to predict whether two persons will be good friends or not. It turns out that each person has an inner friendship number (a positive integer). And the quality of friendship between two persons is equal to the greatest common divisor of their friendship number. That means there are prime people (with a prime friendship number) who just can't find a good friend, andWait, this is irrelevant to this problem. You are given a list of friendship numbers for several people. Find the highest possible quality of friendship among all pairs of given people.
Input
The first line of the input file contains an integer n () — the number of people to process. The next n lines contain one integer each, between 1 and  (inclusive), the friendship numbers of the given people. All given friendship numbers are distinct.
Output
Output one integer — the highest possible quality of friendship. In other words, output the greatest greatest common divisor among all pairs of given friendship numbers.

1. Abridged problem statement  
Given n distinct positive integers (friendship numbers), each up to 2^20, find the maximum greatest common divisor (GCD) over all pairs of these numbers.

2. Key observations  
- If two numbers have GCD = d, then both are multiples of d.  
- Conversely, if at least two input numbers are multiples of d, then there exists a pair with GCD at least d.  
- We want the largest d for which at least two numbers in the input are divisible by d.  
- The input values are bounded by M = 2^20 = 1 048 576, so we can afford an array of size M.  
- To count how many numbers are multiples of d, we can iterate j = d, 2d, 3d, … up to M, and check a boolean array used[j] that marks which numbers appear in the input.  
- Summing over d from 1 to M of (M/d) steps costs O(M log M), which fits in 0.5 s for M = 2^20 in C++.

3. Full solution approach  
a. Read n and the n distinct friendship numbers.  
b. Let M = 1 << 20. Create a boolean array used[0…M) initialized to false.  
c. For each input number x, set used[x] = true.  
d. Initialize answer = 1 (the gcd of any two distinct positive ints is at least 1).  
e. For each candidate d from 1 to M−1:  
   i.   Initialize count = 0.  
   ii.  For j = d; j < M; j += d:  
         - If used[j] is true, increment count.  
         - If count reaches 2, break out of the loop.  
   iii. If count ≥ 2, update answer = max(answer, d).  
f. After processing all d, output answer.

Time complexity:  
- Marking used[] takes O(n).  
- The double loop over d and its multiples costs O(M log M).  

Memory: O(M).
