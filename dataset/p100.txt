1. Abridged Problem Statement  
Given two positive integers A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10 000), compute and output their sum.

2. Detailed Editorial  
Problem restatement  
• You are given two integers A and B, each between 1 and 10 000. You must compute A + B and print the result.

Constraints and implications  
• A, B up to 10 000 → their sum is at most 20 000, well within a 32-bit int.  
• Only two numbers → time complexity O(1), memory footprint negligible.

Solution approach  
1. Read two integers from standard input.  
2. Compute their sum using built-in integer addition.  
3. Print the result to standard output.  

Implementation details  
• In C++ you can use cin/cout or scanf/printf. Because the input is tiny, performance is trivial.  
• In Python you can use input().split() to parse the two numbers and then print their sum.  
• No edge cases beyond ensuring the inputs are parsed correctly—negative numbers are not allowed by the statement.

Complexity  
• Time complexity: O(1).  
• Memory complexity: O(1).

#include <bits/stdc++.h>               // Includes all standard headers  
#define endl '\n'                     // Define endl as newline character for faster output  

using namespace std;

// Utility to update x to maximum of x and y (not used here but commonly available)
template<class T, class T2>
inline void chkmax(T& x, const T2& y) {
    if (x < y) {
        x = y;
    }
}

// Utility to update x to minimum of x and y (not used here but commonly available)
template<class T, class T2>
inline void chkmin(T& x, const T2& y) {
    if (x > y) {
        x = y;
    }
}

const int MAXN = (1 << 20);          // Just a constant (not used in this problem)

int a, b;                             // Global variables for the two input integers

// Reads two integers from standard input into globals a and b
void read() {
    cin >> a >> b;
}

// Computes the sum of a and b and writes it to standard output
void solve() {
    cout << a + b << endl;
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); // Disable C I/O synchronization for speed
    cin.tie(NULL);                    // Untie cin from cout

    read();   // Read input values into a and b
    solve();  // Compute and print the sum
    return 0; // Exit
}

4. Python Solution with Detailed Comments  
```python
# Read a line from standard input, split into tokens, convert to integers
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Compute the sum of the two integers
result = a + b

# Print the result
print(result)
```

5. Compressed Editorial  
Read two integers (≤ 10 000), add them, and print the result. Time and space complexities are both constant.
