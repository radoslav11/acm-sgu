1. Abridged Problem Statement  
Given N integers a₁…aₙ (1 ≤ aᵢ ≤ M) and a modulus M, choose a subset S of indices so that the product of the selected aᵢ’s taken modulo M is as large as possible. If S is empty, the product is defined as 1. Output the maximum achievable value and any corresponding subset of lever indices (in increasing order).

2. Detailed Editorial  
We need to maximize (∏_{i∈S} aᵢ) mod M. A classic way is to use dynamic programming over prefixes and current remainder:

  • Define dp[i][r] = true if using some subset of the first i levers we can get product ≡ r (mod M).  
  • Base: dp[0][1] = true (empty set gives product 1), all other dp[0][*] = false.  
  • Transition for lever i (1-based): for each remainder r such that dp[i−1][r] is true,  
      – Skip lever i: dp[i][r] = true.  
      – Take lever i: dp[i][(r·aᵢ)%M] = true.  
  • Track a 2D array `take[i][r]` = true if the move “take lever i” was used to reach dp[i][r].  

After filling dp[N][*], scan r from M−1 down to 0 to find the maximum reachable remainder max_r. That is your answer.  

To recover which levers were taken, backtrack:
  • Start with curr = max_r at i = N.  
  • For i from N down to 1, if take[i][curr] is true, record i in the answer list and set curr to some r′ such that dp[i−1][r′] was true and (r′·aᵢ)%M == curr.  
  • Reverse the recorded list to get levers in increasing order.

Time complexity: O(N·M). With N ≤ 10⁴ and M ≤ 10³, this runs in about 10⁷ steps, which fits in 0.5 s.

5. Compressed Editorial  
- DP states dp[i][r]: using first i levers, can achieve mod-product r.  
- Transitions: skip lever i → dp[i+1][r], or take lever i → dp[i+1][(r·aᵢ)%M].  
- Record “take” flags to backtrack.  
- Answer = largest r (from M−1 down) with dp[N][r] = true.  
- Backtrack by reversing take decisions, recovering indices in O(N·M).
