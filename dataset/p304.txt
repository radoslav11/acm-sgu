1. Abridged Problem Statement  
Kate has N teeth distributed over K gums. Treating the i-th tooth costs Aᵢ, and if she treats ≥1 tooth on gum j she must pay a fixed anesthesia cost Bⱼ. Given a total budget P, choose a subset of teeth to maximize the number of treated teeth. Output that maximum count and any valid list of tooth indices.

2. Detailed Editorial  

Problem Reformulation  
- You have K groups (gums).  
- In group j there are nⱼ teeth, each with treatment cost aᵢ.  
- If you take at least one item from group j you pay a group‐fixed cost Bⱼ once.  
- You have a total budget P. Maximize the total items selected.  

This is a “grouped knapsack” where each group carries:  
 • A fixed setup cost Bⱼ if you pick ≥1 from that group.  
 • Individual costs aᵢ for each picked item in the group.  
 • We want to maximize total picked items under budget P.  

DP State  
Let dp[g][t] = minimal total cost to select exactly t teeth from the first g gums.  
We will maintain dp as an array of size (K+1)×(N+1), initialized to ∞ except dp[0][0] = 0.  

Transitions  
For gum index g from 0 to K−1, consider two options for each achievable t:  
1. Take zero teeth from gum g+1:  
   dp[g+1][t] = min(dp[g+1][t], dp[g][t])  
2. Take p ≥1 teeth (up to min(n_g, N−t)) from this gum:  
   - First sort that gum’s teeth by ascending aᵢ.  
   - Precompute prefix sums of those sorted costs.  
   - The incremental cost of taking p teeth is B[g] + prefix_sum[p].  
   - Update dp[g+1][t+p] = min(dp[g+1][t+p], dp[g][t] + incremental_cost).  

After filling all K groups, scan t from 0…N to find the maximum t such that dp[K][t] ≤ P. That t is your answer.  

Reconstruction  
To reconstruct which teeth were taken:  
- Store for each dp[g+1][…] the value p of how many teeth you picked from gum g (or −1 if 0).  
- Starting from (g=K, t=best_t), step g→g−1, read p = choice[g][t], if p>0 add the first p sorted tooth indices of gum g to the solution list, and set t := t−p.  

Complexity  
- Sorting each gum’s teeth total O(N log N).  
- DP has K stages, each stage loops t=0..N and p up to n_g. So overall O(∑₍g₌1₎^K (N·n_g)) = O(N²). With N≤600 this is ~360K operations, easily within time.

5. Compressed Editorial  
- Group teeth by gum, sort each group’s costs.  
- Use dp[g][t] = minimal cost to pick t teeth from first g gums.  
- Transition by either skipping a gum or paying B[g]+prefix_sum of p smallest in that gum.  
- Scan dp[K][t] for largest t ≤ P. Reconstruct via stored pick counts.
