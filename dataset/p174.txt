1. Concise Problem Statement  
Given M axis-aligned wall segments in the plane, each defined by its two endpoints. No two walls overlap except possibly at endpoints. Walls are added one by one in the given order. Find the index (1-based) of the first wall whose addition creates a closed loop (i.e., completes a cycle of connected segments enclosing some area). If no cycle ever forms, output 0.

2. Detailed Editorial  

Overview  
We have an undirected graph whose vertices are the wall endpoints (points with integer coordinates) and whose edges are the walls. We add edges in sequence and must detect the first moment an added edge connects two vertices that were already connected by previous edges—this exactly corresponds to forming a cycle in the graph, hence enclosing some region.

Key Observations  
- A cycle in a graph corresponds to adding an edge between two vertices that are already in the same connected component.  
- We do not need to compute actual enclosed areas or perform any planar embedding; mere connectivity in the graph is sufficient for detection.

Data Structures  
- Disjoint-Set Union (DSU), also known as Union-Find, supports two operations in (amortized) nearly O(1) time:  
  • find(u): returns the representative (root) of u’s set.  
  • union(u,v): merges the sets containing u and v.  
- A hash map that assigns each distinct endpoint (x,y) a unique integer ID on the fly.

Algorithm  
1. Initialize an empty DSU of size up to 2·M (each wall contributes at most 2 new endpoints).  
2. Initialize an empty map `mp` from point→ID.  
3. For each wall i from 1 to M:  
   a. Read its endpoints (x1,y1),(x2,y2).  
   b. If a point is not yet in `mp`, assign it a new ID.  
   c. Let u = ID(x1,y1), v = ID(x2,y2).  
   d. If find(u) == find(v), output i and terminate (cycle formed).  
   e. Else, union(u,v) and continue.  
4. If we finish all M walls without detecting a cycle, output 0.

Complexities  
- Each DSU operation is inverse-Ackermann, effectively constant.  
- Mapping points uses a hash (or balanced map) giving O(log N) or O(1) average per lookup.  
- Total time is O(M α(M) + M log M) or O(M α(M)).  
- Memory is O(M).

5. Compressed Editorial  
Use a Union-Find structure over the wall endpoints. Map each point to a unique ID on demand. As you add each wall (edge), check if its two endpoints are already connected in the DSU; if yes, report the current index (first cycle formed), otherwise merge their sets. If no cycle is detected after all M walls, output 0. This runs in O(M α(M)) time and O(M) memory.
