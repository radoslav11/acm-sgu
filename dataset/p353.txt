1. Abridged Problem Statement  
Kate’s outgoing calls are billed as follows: a flat fee of p1 cents covers the first k1 seconds; the next k2 seconds cost p2 cents per second; any further seconds cost p3 cents per second. Charges are deducted at the end of each second, and if her balance becomes non-positive, the call drops immediately. Given an initial balance N cents, compute the maximum whole seconds she can talk.

2. Detailed Editorial  

Define cost(x) as the total charge if Kate talks for x seconds. We must find the largest integer x≥0 such that cost(x)≤N. The billing scheme yields a non-decreasing piecewise linear cost function:

  • If x=0, cost=0 (no call).  
  • If 1≤x≤k1, cost=p1.  
  • If k1+1≤x≤k1+k2, cost=p1+(x−k1)·p2.  
  • If x>k1+k2, cost=p1+k2·p2+(x−k1−k2)·p3.  

Since cost(x) is monotonic in x, we can find the maximum x with cost(x)≤N by:  
  A. A single O(1) greedy pass:  
    1. If N<p1, answer=0 (cannot start).  
    2. Otherwise, subtract p1, grant k1 seconds.  
    3. From remaining balance, use as many of the next k2 seconds as possible at p2 each.  
    4. Finally, use all leftover balance on p3-priced seconds.  
  B. Or by binary searching x over [0, LIMIT], evaluating cost(x) in O(1).  

Both run in constant or logarithmic time, easily within constraints.

```python
import sys
data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()
N, k1, k2, p1, p2, p3 = map(int, data)

def max_talk_time(N, k1, k2, p1, p2, p3):
    # If not enough to pay the initial fee, cannot talk at all
    if N < p1:
        return 0

    # Pay initial flat fee
    N -= p1
    total_seconds = k1  # First k1 seconds are covered

    # Next k2 seconds cost p2 each
    take2 = min(k2, N // p2)
    total_seconds += take2
    N -= take2 * p2

    # Remaining seconds cost p3 each
    take3 = N // p3
    total_seconds += take3

    return total_seconds

print(max_talk_time(N, k1, k2, p1, p2, p3))
```

5. Compressed Editorial  
Let cost(x) be the total charge for x seconds: p1 for up to k1 s, then min(x−k1,k2)·p2, then max(0,x−k1−k2)·p3. We seek the largest x with cost(x)≤N. Since cost is monotonic, either binary-search x or directly deduct p1 if N≥p1, grant k1 seconds, then use remaining balance to buy at rates p2 (up to k2 s) and p3.
