1. Abridged Problem Statement  
Given N chains of lengths L1…LN, you wish to join them into a single chain. In one minute you may open exactly one link (reducing its chain’s length by 1), use that open link to connect one of the remaining chains, then close it. Compute the minimum minutes needed to connect all chains into one.

2. Detailed Editorial  
Goal: starting from N separate chains, we must perform exactly N–1 connections (each reduces the count of separate chains by 1) to end up with a single chain. Each connection consumes one original link (we open it, hook on another chain, and close it), so we must select which chains supply those N–1 links.

Greedy idea: if you repeatedly break links from the currently shortest chain, you keep larger chains intact and available to be hooked on one by one. Once the shortest chain is exhausted, you move on to the next-shortest chain. Meanwhile you always attach to the largest remaining chains to minimize wasted capacity. Concretely:

1. Sort the array of lengths in nondecreasing order.  
2. Let left = 0 (points at shortest chain), right = N−1 (points at the chain we’re about to attach next), time = 0.  
3. While left < right:  
   a. If lengths[left] > 0:  
      – “Break” one link from chain[left] (lengths[left]– –)  
      – Attach chain[right] by using that link (so one fewer chain remains ⇒ right– –)  
      – time++  
      – If chain[left] is now empty (length 0), advance left++ to pick the next chain for breaking.  
   b. Else (lengths[left] == 0), just advance left++.  
4. When left == right, we have connected all other chains into the one at index right; output time.

Correctness: This uses exactly one link per connection, making N–1 connections in total. By always using the currently shortest chain’s links first, we ensure that no larger chain is “wasted” as a source of connectors until needed. Sorting plus two pointers gives an O(N log N) solution.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);

    int N;
    cin >> N;
    vector<int> L(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        cin >> L[i];            // Read each chain length
    }

    sort(L.begin(), L.end());   // Sort lengths ascending

    int left = 0;               // Index of current chain to break links from
    int right = N - 1;          // Index of next chain to attach
    int time = 0;               // Total minutes spent

    // Continue until we've attached all chains (when left == right, only the final chain remains)
    while (left < right) {
        if (L[left] > 0) {
            // Step 1: open one link from chain[left]
            L[left]--;

            // Step 2: attach chain[right] using that open link
            right--;

            // Step 3: one minute has passed
            time++;

            // If chain[left] has no links left, move to the next chain
            if (L[left] == 0) {
                left++;
            }
        } else {
            // If this chain is already depleted, skip it
            left++;
        }
    }

    cout << time << "\n";       // Output the total time
    return 0;

```python
def minimum_time_to_connect_chains():
    import sys
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    # Read all chain lengths and sort ascending
    lengths = sorted(map(int, data[1:]))

    left, right = 0, n - 1   # two pointers: source chains (left) and chains to attach (right)
    time = 0

    # While there is more than one chain remaining
    while left < right:
        if lengths[left] > 0:
            # Open one link from the shortest available chain
            lengths[left] -= 1
            # Use it to attach the chain at 'right'
            right -= 1
            # Count one minute
            time += 1
            # If we've exhausted this chain as a source, move to next
            if lengths[left] == 0:
                left += 1
        else:
            # If no links remain in this source chain, skip it

5. Compressed Editorial  
Sort the chain lengths. Repeatedly open one link from the current shortest chain (decrement its length) to attach the largest remaining chain, counting one minute per operation. Move to the next shortest chain when it’s depleted. This greedy two-pointer approach uses exactly one link per merge and runs in O(N log N).
