258. Almost Lucky Numbers
time limit per test: 0.25 sec.
memory limit per test: 65536 KB
input: standard
output: standard



The number is called lucky if it consists of 2N digits and the sum of the first N digits is equal to the sum of the last N digits. The number is called almost lucky, if it is possible to change one of its digits to some other in such a way, that a new number is lucky. Your task is to find the count of almost lucky numbers in the interval from A to B (including A and B).

The first digit can't be changed to zero because of leading zeroes are not allowed.

Input
The only line of the input file contains two integer numbers A and B (0 <= A <= B <= 10^9).

Output
Output the only number - the requested number of almost lucky numbers.

Sample test(s)

Input
1 99

Output
81

Note
All two-digits not lucky numbers are almost lucky.

1. Abridged Problem Statement  
You are given two integers A and B (0 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 10^9). A number of even length 2N is called lucky if the sum of its first N digits equals the sum of its last N digits. It is almost lucky if by changing exactly one of its digits (the first digit cannot become zero) you can make it lucky. Count how many almost lucky numbers lie in the interval [A, B].

2. Key Observations  
- Only numbers of even digit-length (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) can be lucky or almost lucky.  
- For a candidate number, define  
  balance = (sum of first half) – (sum of second half).  
  If balance = 0, it is already lucky; we skip it. Otherwise:  
  • If balance < 0, we need to increase one digit by at least –balance.  
  • If balance > 0, we need to decrease one digit by at least balance.  
- As we build a number digit by digit (from most significant to least), we can track:  
  a) current balance,  
  b) the maximum possible single-digit increase so far (max_inc),  
  c) the maximum possible single-digit decrease so far (max_dec),  
  d) a tight flag indicating whether we are still restricted by the prefix of an upper bound.  
- At the end, the number is almost lucky if balance≠0 and either max_inc ≥ –balance (when balance<0) or max_dec ≥ balance (when balance>0).

3. Full Solution Approach  
a. We want count_almost(B) – count_almost(A–1), where count_almost(X) is the count of almost lucky numbers ≤ X.  
b. To compute count_almost(X):  
   - Convert X to its decimal string S and let D = length(S).  
   - For each even length L = 2, 4, …, up to D:  
     · If L < D, set bound = string of L ‘9’s (“99”, “9999”, …).  
     · Else (L = D), set bound = S.  
     · Run a digit-DP on bound to count how many almost lucky numbers of length L are ≤ bound.  
c. Digit-DP state: dp(pos, balance, max_inc, max_dec, tight) = number of ways to fill positions [pos..L–1] so that when completed the number is almost lucky.  
   - pos ∈ [0..L], balance ∈ [–9N..+9N], max_inc∈[0..9], max_dec∈[0..9], tight∈{0,1}.  
   - Transition: choose digit d from 0..(tight?bound[pos]:9), except at pos=0 choose from 1..limit.  
       * Update new_balance = balance ± d (plus if pos<N, minus otherwise).  
       * Update new_max_inc/new_max_dec based on how much you could raise or lower this digit.  
       * new_tight = tight & (d == limit).  
   - Base case pos=L: return 1 if balance≠0 and the tracked max_inc/max_dec suffice to fix |balance|; otherwise 0.  
d. Memoize results to achieve O(L × range(balance) × 10 × 10 × 2 × 10) per length, which is very fast for L≤10.  
e. Sum over all even lengths and subtract to get the answer for [A, B].
