1. Abridged Problem Statement  
Given an undirected graph of N people (nodes) where each node has at least ⌈(N+1)/2⌉ friends (edges), find a Hamiltonian cycle starting and ending at node 1 (visiting all nodes exactly once). If none exists, print “No solution”. Otherwise, print N+1 node indices (1-based) that form the cycle.

2. Detailed Editorial  

We need to construct a Hamiltonian cycle in a Dirac graph (every vertex has degree ≥ N/2), so by Dirac’s theorem a cycle exists for N≥3. We use a classic “rotation” (or “insertion”) algorithm that runs in O(N³) worst-case but performs adequately up to N=1000 in optimized C++.

Outline of the algorithm:  
1. Label vertices from 0 to N–1, start with cycle = [0], pos[0]=0, pos[v]=–1 for v>0. Here pos[v] is the “insertion time” of v.  
2. For i from 1 to N–1 (we will insert N–1 more vertices):  
   a. Let u = cycle.back(). Try to find an unvisited neighbor v of u; if found, mark pos[v]=i, append v to cycle, continue.  
   b. Otherwise, u’s unvisited neighbors are all blocked. We wish to perform a rotation:  
      i. Build a Boolean array marked[ ]: for each neighbor w of u that is already in the cycle, mark the successor of w in the current cycle.  
     ii. Scan all unvisited vertices x: if x has any neighbor y with marked[y]=true, we can “rotate.” Let j = pos[y]. Reverse the tail of the cycle from position j+1 to end. This reconnects edges so that u now has a neighbor at the end of the reversed segment.  
    iii. After reversal, append x and set pos[x]=i.  
3. At the end we have a sequence of length N. Output it (1-based) and then repeat the first node to close the cycle.

Key observations:  
- Dirac’s condition (min-degree ≥ N/2) guarantees that step 2b always finds some x, so the algorithm never fails.  
- We maintain pos[v] as the order in which we inserted v; although after a reversal the geometric position of vertices in the cycle changes, pos[] remains consistent with insertion times, which is all we need to locate which segment to reverse next time.  
- Total time: roughly Σᵢ[deg(uᵢ) + N·deg(xᵢ)], up to O(N³) in the worst case, but average performance is much better on dense graphs.

5. Compressed Editorial  
Use Dirac’s theorem on minimum degree ≥ N/2 to guarantee a Hamiltonian cycle. Start from node 1, greedily append an unvisited neighbor. When stuck, mark successors of the last node’s visited neighbors, find an unvisited vertex adjacent to any marked node, then reverse a segment of the current cycle to create the needed edge (“rotation”), and append the new vertex. Repeat until all N vertices are in the cycle, then return to 1. This runs in roughly O(N³) worst-case but works efficiently in practice for N≤1000.
