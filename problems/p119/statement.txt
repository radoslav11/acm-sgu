“Prove that for any integer X and Y if 5X+4Y is divided by 23 than 3X+7Y is divided by 23 too.” The task is from city Olympiad in mathematics in Saratov, Russia for schoolchildren of 8-th form. 2001-2002 year.


For given N and pair (A0, B0) find all pairs (A, B) such that for any integer X and Y if A0X+B0Y is divided by N then AX+BY is divided by N too (0<=A,B<N).


Input

Each input consists of positive integer numbers N, A0 and B0 (N,A0,B0£ 10000) separated by whitespaces.


Output

Write number of pairs (A, B) to the first line of output. Write each pair on a single line in order of non-descreasing A (and B in case of equal A). Separate numbers by single space.
