Masha loves Petya. The following question gives her no rest: does Petya love her too? The best way to find this out is a fortune-telling. There are plenty ways of fortune predicting, but Masha prefers fortune-telling with camomile more than others. It's rules are simple. You should take camomile into the right hand and start picking petals one by one. After each petal you should pronounce one phrase from the predefined list. Such phrases like "loves", "doesn't love", "loves sincerely", "doubts", "wants to date", "laughs" are usually used. Phrases are pronounced from the first to the last. The list of phrases is cyclic, so after the last phrase you should pronounce the first one. The phrase that you pronounce after the last petal will be an answer.

Since Masha doesn't want to go to the forest and look for camomiles, she asks you to write the program which will simulate the process.
