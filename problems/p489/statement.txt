input: standard

A member ai of the sequence a1, a2, ·s, an is called a  if either ai > ai-1 and ai > ai+1 (local maximum) or ai < ai-1 and ai < ai+1 (local minimum). A sequence p1, p2, ·s, pn is called a  of the integers from 1 to n if each of the integers appears in the sequence exactly once. A permutation is called  if each member (except the first and the last) is a local extreme.

Compute the total number of extremal permutations of the integers from 1 to n and output the result modulo m.

Input
The first and only line of the input file contains the integers n () and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 109).

Output
The output file should contain a single integer, the remainder from division of the total number of extremal permutations of integers from 1 to n by the given integer m.

Note. The extremal permutations of 1·s3 are (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1) and (3, 1, 2).
