You've recently started an ice-cream business in a local school. During a day you have many suppliers delivering the ice-cream for you, and many students buying it from you. You are not allowed to set the prices, as you are told the price for each piece of ice-cream by the suppliers.

The day is described with a sequence of queries. Each query can be either ARRIVE n c, meaning that a supplier has delivered n pieces of ice-cream priced c each to you, or BUY n t, meaning that a student wants to buy n pieces of ice-cream, having a total of t money. The latter is processed as follows: in case n cheapest pieces of ice-cream you have cost no more than t (together), you sell those n cheapest pieces to the student; in case they cost more, she gets nothing. You start the day with no ice-cream.

For each student, output HAPPY if she gets her ice-cream, and UNHAPPYif she doesn't.

Input
The input file contains between 1 and 105 queries (inclusive), each on a separate line. The queries are formatted as described above, either ARRIVE n c or BUY n t, 1 ≤ n, c ≤ 106, 1 ≤ t ≤ 1012.

Output
For each BUY-query output one line, containing either the word HAPPY or the word UNHAPPY (answers should be in the same order as the corresponding queries).
