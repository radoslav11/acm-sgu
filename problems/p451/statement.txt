Sarah is a girl who likes reading books.

One day, she wondered about the relationship of a family in a mystery novel. The story said,
B is A's father's brother's son, and
C is B's aunt.
Then she asked herself, "So how many degrees of kinship are there between A and C?"

There are two possible relationships between B and C, that is, C is either B's father's sister or B's mother's sister in the story. If C is B's father's sister, C is in the third degree of kinship to A (A's father's sister). On the other hand, if C is B's mother's sister, C is in the fifth degree of kinship to A (A's father's brother's wife's sister).

You are a friend of Sarah's and good at programming. You can help her by writing a general program to calculate the maximum and minimum degrees of kinship between A and C under given relationship.

The relationship of A and C is represented by a sequence of the following basic relations: father, mother, son, daughter, husband, wife, brother, sister, grandfather, grandmother, grandson, granddaughter, uncle, aunt, nephew, and niece. Here are some descriptions about these relations:
X's brother is equivalent to X's father's or mother's son not identical to X.
X's grandfather is equivalent to X's father's or mother's father.
X's grandson is equivalent to X's son's or daughter's son.
X's uncle is equivalent to X's father's or mother's brother.
X's nephew is equivalent to X's brother's or sister's son.
Similar rules apply to sister, grandmother, granddaughter, aunt and niece.


In this problem, you can assume there are none of the following relations in the family: adoptions, marriages between relatives (i.e.\ the family tree has no cycles), divorces, remarriages, bigamous marriages and same-sex marriages.

The degree of kinship is defined as follows:
The distance from X to X's father, X's mother, X's son or X's daughter is one.
The distance from X to X's husband or X's wife is zero.
The degree of kinship between X and Y is equal to the shortest distance from X to Y deduced from the above rules.

Input
The input is given by one line in the following format:

C is A('s relation)*

Here, relation is one of the following: father, mother, son, daughter, husband, wife, brother, sister, grandfather, grandmother, grandson, granddaughter, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece. An asterisk denotes zero or more occurance of portion surrounded by the parentheses. The number of relations is at most ten.

Output
Print a line containing the maximum and minimum degrees of kinship separated by space.
