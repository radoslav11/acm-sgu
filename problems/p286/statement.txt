The ancient race ofhas built N cities connected with two-way roads. They believed in magic of an even number K and built the roads in such a way that each city had exactly K roads going from it.

The Hollars decided to decorate some roads because of their religious holiday. Because they also believe in magic of an even number 2, each city must have exactly 2 decorated roads going from it.

You have to find the roads needing to be decorated.
