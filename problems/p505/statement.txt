Andrew has just made a breakthrough in biology: he realized that most of genome's characteristics are determined by the absence or presence of certain prefixes and suffixes. So he needs to quickly test large arrays of genomes for that. More formally, we represent the genome as a string of lowercase English letters. We are given several genomes, and need to answer the following type of question: how many genomes from the given set have the given string p as prefix  the given string s as suffix.
Input
The first line of the input file contains an integer n — the number of genomes. The next n lines contain a non-empty string of lowercase English letters each, representing the given genomes. The total length of all given genomes doesn't exceed . The next line contains an integer m — the number of questions to answer. The next m lines contain two non-empty strings of lowercase English letters each, the first denoting the prefix and the second denoting the suffix. The prefix and suffix are separated with a single space. The total length of all given prefixes plus the total length of all given suffixes doesn't exceed .
Output
Output m integers one per line. i-th output line should contain the number of genomes that have i-th given prefix and i-th given suffix.
