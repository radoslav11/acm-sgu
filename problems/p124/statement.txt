There is a closed broken line on a plane with sides parallel to coordinate axes, without self-crossings and self-contacts. The broken line consists of K segments. You have to determine, whether a given point with coordinates (X0,Y0) is inside this closed broken line, outside or belongs to the broken line.


Input

The first line contains integer K (4 Ј K Ј 10000) - the number of broken line segments. Each of the following N lines contains coordinates of the beginning and end points of the segments (4 integer xi1,yi1,xi2,yi2; all numbers in a range from -10000 up to 10000 inclusive). Number separate by a space. The segments are given in random order. Last line contains 2 integers X0 and Y0 - the coordinates of the given point delimited by a space. (Numbers X0, Y0 in a range from -10000 up to 10000 inclusive).


Output

The first line should contain:

INSIDE - if the point is inside closed broken line,

OUTSIDE - if the point is outside,

BORDER - if the point belongs to broken line.
