Series of bloody civil wars in Berland finished! After the long-awaited reunion it was decided to create new Berland flag. Berland Heraldic Council proposed following requirements:

1. Berland flag must be a rectangle of Nx M cells. Each cell must be painted with blue or red;

2. any 3x 2 or 2x 3 rectangle of the flag must have exactly two blue cells;

3. blue paint is very expensive, so the number of blue cells should as low as possible.

Write a program that creates Berland flag.

Input
Input file contains two integer numbers N and M (3 ≤ N, M ≤ 200) separated by a space.

Output
Print to the output file N lines with M characters on each line: j-th character on the i-th line must be 0 (zero) if the cell (i, j) painted with read, and "#" if it is blue. If there are several solutions output any of them. Print "No solution" (without quotes) if there is no solution.
