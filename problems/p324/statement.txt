The Library of Berland has an ancient document with text composed of words, spaces and "-"  characters. A word is a sequence of Latin letters. The chief librarian asked you to format the text from the document by adding and removing spaces. There are special rules for using the "-"  character in the ancient documents which you need to obey.

The "-"  character can be used as:
Hyphen, in this case a word should be started and finished to the right and to the left from it. For example, "co-coach" .
A part of the short dash, in this case two characters "-"  should be used with a space to the right and to the left. For example, " -- " .
A part of the long dash, in this case three characters "-"  should be used with a space to the right and to the left. For example, " --- " .


If there is no "-"  character between words, the words should be delimited by a single space.

The resulting text should not have any other space characters.

Input
The first line of the input contains N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) — the number of lines with the text of the document to be formatted. Each of the following N lines contains the quoted text of the document to be formatted. The length of the text of each document is not less than 1 and not more than 100 characters.

Output
For each document from the input write a separate line with the formatted text enclosed in quotes to the output. If it is impossible to correctly format the text, write the only word "error"  without quotes. If there are several solutions, choose any of them.
