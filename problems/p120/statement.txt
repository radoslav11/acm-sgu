Archipelago Ber-Islands consists of N islands that are vertices of equiangular and equilateral N-gon. Islands are clockwise numerated. Coordinates of island N1 are (x1, y1), and island N2 – (x2, y2). Your task is to find coordinates of all N islands.


Input

In the first line of input there are N, N1 and N2 (3£ N£ 150, 1£ N1,N2£N, N1¹N2) separated by spaces. On the next two lines of input there are coordinates of island N1 and N2 (one pair per line) with accuracy 4 digits after decimal point. Each coordinate is more than -2000000 and less than 2000000.


Output

Write N lines with coordinates for every island. Write coordinates in order of island numeration. Write answer with 6 digits after decimal point.
