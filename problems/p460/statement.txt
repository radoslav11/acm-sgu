In the English language, nouns are inflected by grammatical number — that is singular or plural. In this problem we use a simple model of constructing plural from a singular form. This model doesn't always make English plural forms correctly, but it works in most cases. Forget about the real rules you know while solving the problem and use the statement as a formal document.

You are given several nouns in a singular form and your program should translate them into plural form using the following rules:


If a singular noun ends with ch, x, s, o the plural is formed by adding es. For example, witch -> witches, tomato -> tomatoes.

If a singular noun ends with f or fe, the plural form ends with ves. For example, leaf -> leaves, knife -> knives. Pay attention to the letter f becoming v.

Nouns ending with y change the ending to ies in plural. For example, family -> families.

In all other cases plural is formed by adding s. For example, book -> books.
