Oh no, here it comes again
Can't remember when we came so close to love before
Hold on, good things never last
Nothing's in the past, it always seems to come again
Again and again and again

...

Bloodied angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows, shining ever-bright

Neon Knights!

Black Sabbath, "Neon Knights"


The knight is the piece in the game of chess. The knight moves the following way: first he moves 2 squares in horizontal or vertical direction and then 1 square in the perpendicular direction. Figures on the way of knight do not interfere with its movement. Two knights are in the attacking position if they can move to each other's cells.
