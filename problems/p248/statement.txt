You are to solve some problem of integer linear programming. It is posed in the following way. Let x[i] be a variable which is required to be a non-negative integer (for any i from [1..N]). The goal is to minimize the function f(x[1], x[2],..., x[N])=x[1]+x[2]+...+x[N] (objective function) satisfying the constraint c[1]*x[1]+c[2]*x[2]+...+c[N]*x[N]=V.
The point X=(x[1], x[2],..., x[N]) that satisfies the constraint is called "feasible". All feasible points form a feasible set.
To make things clear, let us consider the following example N=2, c[1]=2, c[2]=4, V=6. There are only two feasible points: (1, 1) and (3, 0).
Clearly, the point (1, 1) is the optimal solution, because f(1, 1)<f(3, 0).

Input
The first line of input contains a single positive integer N (0<N<=3). The second line contains N positive integers c[i] separated by whitespaces (0<c[i]<=10^6). The last line contains positive integer V (0<V<=10^6).

Output
On the first line of the output file print the minimal possible value of the function f, or "-1" (without quotes) if the problem has no solution.
