input: standard
output: standard



The number is called lucky if it consists of 2N digits and the sum of the first N digits is equal to the sum of the last N digits. The number is called almost lucky, if it is possible to change one of its digits to some other in such a way, that a new number is lucky. Your task is to find the count of almost lucky numbers in the interval from A to B (including A and B).

The first digit can't be changed to zero because of leading zeroes are not allowed.

Input
The only line of the input file contains two integer numbers A and B (0 <= A <= B <= 10^9).

Output
Output the only number - the requested number of almost lucky numbers.
