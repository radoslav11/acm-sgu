He wrote n letters "X" and "E" in a circle. He thought that there were 2n possibilities to do it, because each letter may be either "X" or "E". But Qc noticed that some different sequences of letters can be transformed one to another with a circular shift (thus representing actually the same circular string).
For example, strings "XXE"-"XEX"-"EXX" are actually the same.
Qc wants to know how many different circular strings of n letters exist. Help him to find that out.


Input
The input file contains a single integer 1 <= n <= 200000.

Output
Output a single integer --- the number circular strings of length n.
