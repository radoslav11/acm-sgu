input: standard

It is well known that three segments can make a triangle if and only if the sum of lengths of any two of them is strictly greater than the length of the third one. Professor Vasechkin has N segments. He asked you, if you could find at least one set of three segments among them which can be used by professor to make a triangle.

Input
The first line of the input contains the only integer number N (3≤ N≤ 1000). The following N lines contain the length of segments professor has. The length of any segment is the integer number from 1 to 10500.

Output
Write to the output the length of segments requested by the professor — three numbers delimited by spaces. Write three zeros if there are no such three segments.
